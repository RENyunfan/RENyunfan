# Hi there 🙌

My name is **Yunfan REN** 👨‍🎓, and I am a Ph.D. in Robotics from the [University of Hong Kong](https://hku.hk/), where I worked in the [MaRS Lab](https://mars.hku.hk/). I am preparing to start a postdoctoral position, with details to be confirmed. My research focuses on **UAV autonomous navigation**, **robotic swarm systems**, and **optimal control**.

I have published **20** papers during my Ph.D. in leading journals and conferences, including:
